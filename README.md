# Jarvis_RobotArm

**Jarvis_RobotArm** is a simple, 4-DOF robotic arm designed for desktop-scale automation, educational use, and computer vision integration. Built for flexibility and expandability, this open-source project combines 3D-printed mechanical components, servo motors, and microcontroller-based control for precise motion tasks such as pick-and-place, object tracking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- 4 Degrees of Freedom (Base, Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist)
- Lightweight, modular design with 3D-printed components
- Controlled via Arduino UNO
- Servo motors 
- Camera mount for OpenCV-based object tracking
- Designed for rapid prototyping and educational demos

## üì¶ Components Used
- DXW90 servo motor
- Arduino UNO
- Custom 3D-printed links and joints  
- OpenCV (Python) for vision tasks (optional)

## üí° Project Goals
- Provide a low-cost, open-source robot arm platform  
- Practice inverse kinematics, control systems, and real-time feedback  
- Enable integration with AI and machine vision for object interaction  
- Serve as a co-bot for tasks like tool passing or small assembly work  

## üîß Status
**Currently under development**: design optimization, wiring diagrams, Arduino/Python firmware, and vision-based control scripts are being uploaded progressively.
